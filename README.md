## 🌎 What is ATLAS?

ATLAS is a coding assistant that runs on your own GPU. Point it at a project and it does the kind of work you'd ask Claude or Copilot to do: read a codebase, write a feature, fix a bug. The model never leaves your machine.

Open models aren't usually competitive with hosted ones. ATLAS gets there anyway by wrapping the model in a layer of inference scaffolding: planning before generation, verifying answers against self-generated tests, repairing the failures. The 14B reference build scored 74.6% on LiveCodeBench. Same scaffolding now runs on a 9B that fits on a $500 GPU.

  - a. [C(x) Cost Field](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#scoring-models) - 4096→512→128→1 MLP that scores candidate quality
  - b. [G(x) Quality Prediction](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#scoring-models) - XGBoost ensemble used for selection
  - c. [RAG / PageIndex V2](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#rag--pageindex-v2) - AST-aware code retrieval and project indexing
  - d. [Confidence Router](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#confidence-router--pattern-cache) - Thompson Sampling routes compute to the candidates that need it

5. **[Sandbox](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#6-sandbox)** - isolated execution for build verification.

## 🚀 Get Started

One-shot install:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itigges22/ATLAS/main/scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh | bash
```
The script detects your distro (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, Fedora, Rocky, Alma), installs Docker and nvidia-container-toolkit, downloads the model weights, builds the ASA steering vector, and starts the stack. Expect 10-30 minutes; the model download is the bottleneck.

Then in any project directory, run `atlas`.

**Requirements**

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU | NVIDIA, 16GB+ VRAM (tested on RTX 5060 Ti 16GB) |
| Runtime | Docker with nvidia-container-toolkit, or Podman |
| Python | 3.9+ |
| Disk | ~20GB (model weights + container images) |

Tested on NVIDIA only. macOS, Windows, and AMD ROCm are on the V3.1.1 roadmap. For the manual install path (Docker Compose, bare-metal, K3s) and the full set of bootstrap flags, see **[SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **NVIDIA-only.** Tested on NVIDIA GPUs. AMD ROCm and Apple Metal are on the V3.1.1 roadmap.
- **9B model is not formally benchmarked yet.** V3.1.0 ships Qwen3.5-9B with the full V3 pipeline, but the canonical 74.6% LiveCodeBench score is from the 14B reference build. Formal 9B numbers land with V3.1.1. The 14B methodology and ablations live in [`docs/reports/V3_ABLATION_STUDY.md`](docs/reports/V3_ABLATION_STUDY.md); raw traces are on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/itigges22/ATLAS).
- **Complex feature additions can be inconsistent.** The model sometimes spends agent turns exploring an unfamiliar codebase before writing code. Reliability has improved on the 9B build since the V3.0 measurement; a fresh number lands with the V3.1.1 benchmark pass.
- **Grammar-constrained decoding is slow.** Around 51 tok/s on llama-server.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**V3.1.0** - Current release. Bubbletea TUI as the canonical chat client (PC-062), `atlas init` first-run wizard (PC-054), `atlas doctor` install diagnostic (PC-053), `atlas tier` hardware-aware presets (PC-055), K3s deployment templates restored, ASA steering vectors auto-built during install (BiasBusters #4).

**V3.1.1** - Next release.
- OS support - macOS and Windows installers.
- Expanded accelerator support - AMD ROCm via llama.cpp; Apple Metal once macOS lands.
- Formal 9B benchmarks - LiveCodeBench, GPQA Diamond, SciCode on Qwen3.5-9B.

## 💖 Support ATLAS

ATLAS is built by a single college student in his free time on a single consumer GPU. If the project has been useful to you and you want to help keep it sustainable, please consider **[sponsoring on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/itigges22)**.

Sponsorship directly funds:

- **Compute & hardware** — more GPUs for faster benchmark iteration, access to architectures the maintainer can't afford (AMD ROCm, higher VRAM cards, cloud rentals for larger-model experiments).
- **Contributor bounties** — meaningful compensation for external contributors who put real time into substantive PRs, so ATLAS can grow faster than a single-person pace allows.
- **Research** — continued academic engagement around the architecture, from future workshop and conference submissions to paper writing and collaborations that validate and extend the approach.
- **Community** — continued support for the community and platforms ATLAS runs on, including documentation, user-facing channels, and educational content that help ATLAS reach more developers and better serve the ones already using it.

Every sponsor is credited in the release notes of the version they helped fund.

## 🤝 Contributing

We're building ATLAS in the open and we're actively looking for contributors and core maintainers. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding accelerator support, or rethinking a whole subsystem - there's a place for you here. If you believe open models deserve better infrastructure, come build with us.

Found a bug or hit a wall? **[Open an issue](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues)** - you don't need to submit a fix. Bug reports and feedback help just as much as code.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for guidelines.
