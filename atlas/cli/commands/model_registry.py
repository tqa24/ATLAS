"""atlas model registry — known models + their lens artifact status
(PC-056, hardened in PC-056.1).

Single source of truth for "which models can ATLAS run end-to-end?"

This module is the upgrade-in-place of PC-055.2's
`model_recommendations.py` stub. It preserves the stable public API
(`for_tier`, `tier_for_model`, the Model record's name-compat fields)
that doctor + tier callers depend on, while extending each entry with
download metadata + the critical `lens_status` field that captures the
key truth surfaced during PC-056 scoping:

    Most "supported" tier presets in PC-055 are aspirational. Only the
    9B Q6_K model has actual Lens artifacts (metric tensor + embeddings).
    Other entries can be downloaded as raw GGUFs but G(x) silently
    no-ops on them — half of what makes ATLAS *ATLAS* is missing.

`lens_status` makes that visible. The CLI surfaces it; doctor warns on
overshoot; users who want a no-artifacts model must pass `--no-lens`.

Bringing more models to `lens_status: supported` is the work of
PC-058 (`atlas lens build`). PC-057 (`atlas lens check`) is the cheap
pre-flight that says "is this model Lens-compatible at all?" before
you invest hours in PC-058's training pipeline. PC-059 / PC-060 are
the contribution flow that takes locally-trained artifacts and
publishes them back to the registry.

Schema notes:
- `model_file` / `model_display` / `model_size_gb` are kept as field
  names (not renamed to `file`/`display`/`size`) so the PC-055.2
  `ModelRecommendation` API alias works without code changes.
- `download_url` is None for gated/missing upstreams. CLI must check
  before invoking `atlas model install`. **PC-056.1: URLs are pinned
  to a specific HF commit hash** (e.g.,
  `resolve/3885219b…/Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf`) instead of `resolve/main/`,
  so the registered SHA256 stays valid even if upstream re-uploads
  with the same filename.
- `sha256` is the HuggingFace `x-linked-etag` value (the content-addressed
  storage hash) where available. **PC-056.1: actually verified during
  install** (was print-only in PC-056). Verifies download integrity,
  not provenance. Stronger provenance verification is PC-060 territory.
- `lens_status` values:
    "supported"   — metric tensor + embeddings present in repo, has
                    been validated end-to-end against this exact quant
    "no-artifacts" — model exists but Lens won't score it (no tensor
                    trained at all)
    "unverified"  — has artifacts that should structurally apply (e.g.,
                    different quant of the same model family) but the
                    exact combination hasn't been validated
- `lens_artifact_dir` (PC-056.1): Optional override for where this
  model's Lens artifacts live. None = use the global
  ATLAS_LENS_MODELS dir (current single-model layout). When PC-058's
  per-model training pipeline lands, each entry will populate this
  with `geometric-lens/geometric_lens/models/<model_name>/` or similar.
- `lens_artifact_files` (PC-056.1): list of files that must exist in
  the artifact dir for `lens_status: supported` to be honest. Doctor's
  tier_match cross-checks this — if a model claims supported but
  artifacts are missing, that's a config drift that should warn.

PC-056.1 install hardening (relative to PC-056):
- SHA256 enforced at download time (delete file + exit 1 on mismatch)
- Resume from .part file (Range: bytes=N-, append-write)
- HF_TOKEN env var honored (Authorization: Bearer header)
- New `atlas model verify` command for post-install integrity check
