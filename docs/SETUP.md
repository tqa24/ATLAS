# ATLAS Setup Guide

Four deployment methods: **one-shot bootstrap** (recommended for new installs), Docker Compose (manual), bare-metal, or K3s.

---

## Method 0: One-shot bootstrap (PC-051)

Single curl command that detects your distro, installs Docker + nvidia-container-toolkit, sets sysctl knobs, downloads model weights, and brings the stack up. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itigges22/ATLAS/main/scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Or, from a checkout:
```bash
./scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh
```

**Supported distributions:**

| Family | Distros |
|---|---|
| Debian (apt-get) | Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+ |
| RHEL (dnf) | RHEL 9+, Rocky 9+, AlmaLinux 9+, CentOS Stream 9+, Oracle Linux 9+ |
| Fedora (dnf) | Fedora 38+ |

Other distros with `ID_LIKE` matching one of the above (e.g. Linux Mint, Pop!_OS) are accepted with a warning. Distros not in this list — Arch, openSUSE, Alpine, NixOS — aren't tested and the script will refuse to run on them.

The bootstrap works around EPEL, firewalld, `vm.overcommit_memory` (PC-011), nouveau driver conflicts, the missing-libnvidia-ml.so.1 case (RHEL minimal installs), and the "user added to docker group but current shell doesn't see it yet" race.

**Run modes — both work:**

```bash
# Run as your normal user; sudo elevates as needed (Docker install, sysctl, etc).
# Install ends up owned by you.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itigges22/ATLAS/main/scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh | bash

# Run via sudo. SUDO_USER is detected, install still ends up owned by you.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itigges22/ATLAS/main/scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh | sudo bash

# Real root login (no sudo) — install owned by root. Only do this if there's
# no human user on the box (CI runner, container, etc).
```

**Configuration env vars:**

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_DOCKER=1` | Don't install Docker (already managed) |
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_NVIDIA=1` | CPU-only install (no GPU steps) |
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_MODELS=1` | Don't download model weights |
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_COMPOSE=1` | Don't run `docker compose up` |
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_SYSCTL=1` | Don't write `vm.overcommit_memory=1` (CI / unprivileged containers) |
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_ASA=1` | Skip the ASA steering-vector build (default: built ~5 min after services come up) |
| `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_NO_SUDO=1` | Fail instead of attempting sudo |
| `ATLAS_INSTALL_DIR=/path` | Where to clone (default `/opt/atlas` — see below) |
| `ATLAS_REPO_URL=https://...` | Alternate repo URL |

**Why `/opt/atlas`?** It's the standard FHS prefix for system-wide third-party software, survives `$HOME` cleanup, and lets multiple users on the same box share one install. If you'd rather it land in your home dir:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itigges22/ATLAS/main/scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh \
  | ATLAS_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/atlas bash
```

When complete, prints a green "ATLAS ready" banner with quick-start commands. Total time on a fresh VM with a fast connection: ~10-30 minutes (model download dominates).

If you'd rather do each step manually, use Method 1 below.

---

## Prerequisites (All Methods)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **GPU** | 16 GB+ VRAM. NVIDIA (CUDA) is the canonical path; AMD (ROCm) is supported in V3.1.1; Apple Silicon (Metal) is V3.1.2 planned; Intel Arc (SYCL) is roadmap. See [§ Supported GPUs](#supported-gpus). |
| **GPU drivers** | NVIDIA: proprietary drivers (`nvidia-smi` should show your GPU). AMD: `amdgpu-dkms` kernel driver (`/dev/kfd` must exist; `rocm-smi` should show your GPU). |
| **Python 3.9+** | With pip |
| **wget** | For downloading model weights |
| **Model weights** | Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf (~7 GB) from HuggingFace. Apple Silicon ≤16 GB: use Q4_K_M (~5 GB) instead. |

### Verify GPU

**NVIDIA:**

```bash
nvidia-smi
# Should show your GPU with driver version and VRAM
# If this fails, install NVIDIA proprietary drivers first
```

**AMD:**

```bash
rocm-smi --showproductname --showmeminfo vram
# Should show your GPU model and total VRAM
# If rocm-smi is missing or /dev/kfd doesn't exist, install ROCm:
#   RHEL 9: sudo dnf install -y https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/6.2/rhel/9.4/amdgpu-install-6.2.60200-1.el9.noarch.rpm
#           sudo amdgpu-install --usecase=dkms,rocm
#   Ubuntu: Follow https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/
# Then REBOOT.
```

**Easy mode** — let `atlas tier` autodetect across vendors and tell you what it found:

```bash
pip install -e .
atlas tier              # prints detected GPU, tier classification, recommended settings
atlas tier --json       # machine-readable (used by atlas init wizard)
```

---

## Method 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the tested deployment method for V3.1.0+.

### Additional Prerequisites

**NVIDIA (CUDA):**
- **Docker** with [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html), **or Podman** with the same toolkit
- ~20 GB disk space (model weights + container images)

**AMD (ROCm, V3.1.1):**
- **Docker** alone — ROCm doesn't need a separate container runtime; passthrough via `--device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri` is enough
- Your user must be in the `video` and `render` groups: `sudo usermod -aG video,render $USER` (then re-login)
- ~22 GB disk space (ROCm image is ~2 GB larger than the CUDA equivalent)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS

# 2. Download model weights (~7GB)
mkdir -p models
wget https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf \
     -O models/Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf

# 3. Install the ATLAS CLI (puts `atlas` in ~/.local/bin)
pip install --user -e .

# Make sure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH so `atlas` resolves:
case ":$PATH:" in *":$HOME/.local/bin:"*) ;; *)
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
;; esac

# 4. Install Go 1.24+ — required for the TUI client (atlas tui) and
#    optional for the proxy (proxy builds automatically on first run if Go
#    is present; otherwise it runs in Docker with file access limited to
#    ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR). Quickest path:
mkdir -p /tmp/go-install && cd /tmp/go-install
curl -LO https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
cd -

# Then build the TUI:
cd tui && go build -o ~/.local/bin/atlas-tui . && cd ..

# 5. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Defaults work if your model is in ./models/ — edit .env only if you changed the path

# 6. Start all services (first run builds container images — this takes several minutes)
#    NVIDIA hosts (default):
docker compose up -d                                                  # or: podman-compose up -d
#    AMD ROCm hosts (V3.1.1):
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rocm.yml up -d
#    `atlas init` writes a marker comment into .env telling you which to use.

# 7. Verify everything is healthy (wait for all services to show "healthy")
docker compose ps

# 8. Start coding (from your project directory)
cd /path/to/your/project
atlas
```

#### AMD ROCm — what's different

The ROCm path is identical to NVIDIA *except* for these three points:

1. **Bring up with both compose files** (or let `atlas init` do it for you):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rocm.yml up -d
   ```
   The override switches the llama-server image to the ROCm build, swaps the NVIDIA driver request for `/dev/kfd` + `/dev/dri` passthrough, and forces `ATLAS_BACKEND=rocm` so the entrypoint takes the HIP-tuning branch.

2. **No `nvidia-container-toolkit`** — ROCm doesn't need a separate container runtime, just kernel-level device access. Confirm your user is in the right groups:
   ```bash
   id -nG | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -E '^(render|video)$'
   # Should print both. If not:
   sudo usermod -aG video,render $USER
   # Then log out + back in (or: newgrp render)
   ```

3. **GPU compute target.** The default `Dockerfile.rocm` build is a "fat" image covering RDNA3 (7000 series), RDNA2 (6000 series), and CDNA2 (MI200) — `gfx1100;gfx1101;gfx1102;gfx1030;gfx90a`. For a smaller image targeted at your specific GPU, set `ATLAS_GFX_TARGET` before building:
   ```bash
   # Example: only build for RX 7900 XT/XTX
   ATLAS_GFX_TARGET=gfx1100 docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rocm.yml build llama-server
   ```
   See [LLVM AMDGPU processor table](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html) for the gfx target of your card.

For "I have an unsupported GPU but ROCm sort-of works on it" cases (older Vega, RDNA1), see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md § AMD GPU not detected](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the `ATLAS_HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` workaround.

#### Vulkan — the universal fallback (PC-114)

When the native vendor backend isn't packaged for your hardware (Intel Arc, Snapdragon Adreno, older AMD without ROCm 6.x, or some weird combo), Vulkan is the safety-net path. **One Dockerfile, runs on basically everything** — Mesa RADV (AMD), Mesa ANV (Intel), nvidia-container-toolkit (NVIDIA), MoltenVK (Apple via macOS Docker), Adreno (Snapdragon), and Mesa lavapipe (pure CPU fallback).

Tradeoff: typically 20–40% slower than tuned native backends. Use it when CUDA/ROCm isn't an option, or for "does ATLAS even boot on my weird laptop" smoke testing.

```bash
# Option A — let atlas init pick it for you
# (the wizard offers Vulkan when your GPU vendor's native backend isn't packaged,
#  or run with --backend vulkan to force it regardless of vendor):
atlas init --backend vulkan
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.vulkan.yml up -d

# Option B — already-installed deployment, just switch the override file:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.vulkan.yml up -d
# (the entrypoint dispatches on ATLAS_BACKEND, which the compose overlay
#  sets to vulkan; .env's value is ignored when the overlay is in play)
```

What's different from CUDA/ROCm:

1. **No vendor-specific kernel driver requirement.** Vulkan ICDs live inside the image (`mesa-vulkan-drivers` covers AMD/Intel/CPU; NVIDIA's ICD comes from the nvidia-container-toolkit mount).
2. **`/dev/dri` passthrough only** — no `/dev/kfd`, no `--gpus all` (unless you're routing through the NVIDIA toolkit, in which case both still work).
3. **Per-GPU selection via `ATLAS_VK_DEVICE_SELECT`** instead of `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Format is Mesa-standard: `"vendorID:deviceID"` (hex) or a substring of the device name. `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (numeric index) also works.
4. **`atlas doctor`** runs a `_check_vulkan_via_docker` probe — but only when `ATLAS_BACKEND=vulkan` is set (otherwise it skips to keep CUDA/ROCm runs fast).

If you hit `vulkaninfo` showing only the `llvmpipe` CPU device when you expected a GPU, the kernel-side device passthrough failed — verify `/dev/dri/renderD*` exists on the host and your user is in the `video` + `render` groups (same as the ROCm requirement above).

#### arm64 hosts (#115) {#arm64}

ATLAS targets two CPU architectures: `x86_64` (default, all backends available) and `aarch64` (a subset of backends). Verify with `atlas doctor` — the `arch` check surfaces your architecture and which backends are available before the GPU check fires.

**Backend availability by architecture:**

| Backend | x86_64 | aarch64 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CUDA | yes (rockylinux9 base) | yes (sbsa or l4t base, build-arg swap) | DGX Spark = sbsa, Jetson = l4t |
| ROCm | yes | **no** | AMD has no arm64 ROCm release. Use Vulkan instead. |
| Vulkan | yes | yes (Mesa is multi-arch) | Universal fallback for all arm64 GPUs |
| CPU (lavapipe) | yes | yes | Slow but always works |

**Targeted arm64 devices:**

- **NVIDIA DGX Spark** (Grace-Blackwell GB10) — CUDA via sbsa base image, compute cap 12.0/12.1
- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin / AGX / Nano** — CUDA via l4t base image, compute cap 8.7
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)** — Vulkan via MoltenVK in Docker Desktop (slow path); native Metal install tracked at [#32](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/32) for the fast path
- **Snapdragon X Elite** (Windows on ARM laptops) — Vulkan via the Adreno driver
- **Raspberry Pi 5** — Vulkan via Mesa V3D driver, expect CPU-tier performance
- **Ampere Altra / AWS Graviton workstations** — Vulkan via lavapipe (CPU fallback, since no consumer arm64 dGPU yet)

**Building the Vulkan image for arm64:**

```bash
# Multi-arch build that produces a single image manifest covering both archs:
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t atlas-llama-server:vulkan \
  -f inference/Dockerfile.vulkan inference/
```

**Building the CUDA image for arm64** (DGX Spark example):

```bash
# Swap to the sbsa-capable ubuntu base, build with --platform linux/arm64:
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 \
  --build-arg BUILDER_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-devel-ubuntu22.04 \
  --build-arg RUNTIME_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04 \
  -t atlas-llama-server:cuda-arm64 \
  -f inference/Dockerfile.v31 inference/
```

For Jetson, swap to `nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-jetpack:r36.3.0` in both build args (l4t ships JetPack + CUDA + cuDNN as one image).

**Known gaps (#115 tracks these):**

- No prebuilt arm64 images on GHCR yet — arm64 users must build locally with the recipes above. Prebuilt multi-arch images will land once at least one arm64 device has been validated end-to-end.
- Bootstrap installer (`scripts/atlas-install.sh`) hasn't been audited for arm64 paths.
- Hardware testing matrix is empty for all five target devices — early adopters with any of these please drop your `atlas doctor` output and `vulkaninfo --summary` on [#115](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/115).

### What Happens on First Run

1. Docker pulls 5 prebuilt container images from
   `ghcr.io/itigges22/atlas-{proxy,v3,lens,llama,sandbox}` (PC-052,
   ~3 min on a fast connection — replaces the prior ~75 min from-source
   CUDA build). To build from source instead (dev workflow), run
   `docker compose build` before the `up` step — see "Image source"
   below.
2. llama-server loads the 7GB model into GPU VRAM (~1-2 min)
3. All services start health checks
4. Once all 6 services (redis, llama-server, geometric-lens, v3-service, sandbox, atlas-proxy) report healthy, `atlas` connects and launches the Bubbletea TUI

Subsequent `docker compose up -d` starts are fast (seconds) since images are cached.

### Image source: prebuilt vs from-source

`docker-compose.yml` declares both `image:` (GHCR) and `build:` (local
Dockerfile) for every service. Compose's default behavior:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `docker compose up -d`            | Pull `image:` if not in local cache, else reuse local |
| `docker compose pull`             | Force pull latest tag from GHCR (overwrite local cache) |
| `docker compose build`            | Build from `Dockerfile` (overrides GHCR image) |
| `docker compose up -d --build`    | Always rebuild from source then start |

**Tag pinning.** The tag defaults to `latest`. To pin to a specific
version (recommended for production), set `ATLAS_IMAGE_TAG` in `.env`:

```env
ATLAS_IMAGE_TAG=v1.0.0      # semver tag from a git release
ATLAS_IMAGE_TAG=sha-abc1234  # exact commit
ATLAS_IMAGE_TAG=dev          # bleeding edge from dev branch
```

Available tags are listed at <https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/pkgs/container/atlas-proxy>
(swap `atlas-proxy` for the other service names: `atlas-v3`,
`atlas-lens`, `atlas-llama`, `atlas-sandbox`).

> **Hitting `unauthorized` on `compose pull`?** GHCR packages are
> private by default. If a maintainer hasn't yet flipped a package to
> public visibility, `compose pull` fails with `unauthorized`. Two
> escapes: (a) authenticate to GHCR with a personal access token that
> has `read:packages` scope (`echo $TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u
> $USERNAME --password-stdin`), or (b) build from source with
> `docker compose build` and skip the pull entirely.

> **Dev workflow gotcha — `compose pull` overwrites local builds.**
> Both the local-built image and the GHCR-pulled image share the same
> tag (`ghcr.io/<owner>/atlas-<svc>:<tag>`), so `docker compose pull`
> will REPLACE your locally-built image with the registry version and
> wipe your local changes. While iterating on a service, either skip
> `compose pull` entirely (Docker won't auto-pull if a local image is
> present), or set `ATLAS_IMAGE_TAG=dev-local` (any unpublished tag
> name) in `.env` so your local builds and the registry images live
> under different tags.

> **Forks: pointing compose at your own GHCR.** If you've forked the
> repo and your build-images.yml workflow has published images to
> `ghcr.io/<your-username>/atlas-*`, set `ATLAS_GHCR_OWNER=<your-username>`
> in `.env` to pull your fork's images instead of upstream's.

### Verify Installation

The fastest way is **`atlas doctor`** — runs 22 checks across the host
environment, the docker stack, and a live model inference, and returns
exit 0 (healthy) / 1 (failures). This is also what `atlas-bootstrap.sh`
runs at the end of install.

```bash
atlas doctor              # full check (~5–10s)
atlas doctor --quick      # skip the e2e model inference (~2s)
atlas doctor --json       # machine output, for scripts/CI
atlas doctor -v           # verbose: show detail for each check
```

The 22 checks (PC-053 base + later additions):

| Group | Check | What it confirms |
|---|---|---|
| Host | docker | daemon reachable |
| Host | compose | docker compose v2 installed |
| Host | nvidia | nvidia-container-toolkit can run nvidia-smi inside Docker |
| Host | vm.overcommit_memory | set to 1 (PC-011 — Redis AOF) |
| Host | model_file | `Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf` exists and is > 100 MB |
| Host | lens_weights | `cost_field.pt` + `metric_tensor.pt` present |
| Host | asa_steering | `ast_edit_steering.gguf` present (BiasBusters #4 — warn-not-fail; ATLAS works without it, just unsteered ast_edit-vs-edit_file bias) |
| Host | tier_match | `.env` model selection matches host hardware (PC-055; warn on overshoot — OOM risk — pass on match or undershoot) |
| Host | tier_constraints | host CPU/RAM/disk meets the recommended tier minimums (PC-055.1 — catches "16 GB GPU but 8 GB RAM" mismatches) |
| Stack | container/redis, llama-server, geometric-lens, v3-service, sandbox, atlas-proxy | all 6 running and healthy |
| Stack | health/llama, lens, v3, sandbox, proxy | all 5 `/health` endpoints return ok |
| Stack | image_skew | all 5 `atlas-*` images on the same tag (PC-052) |
| End-to-end | e2e_smoke | live `/v1/chat/completions` round-trip to llama-server (`--quick` to skip) |

If you'd rather check by hand:

```bash
# Hit each health endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | python3 -m json.tool   # llama-server
curl -s http://localhost:8099/health | python3 -m json.tool   # geometric-lens
curl -s http://localhost:8070/health | python3 -m json.tool   # v3-service
curl -s http://localhost:30820/health | python3 -m json.tool  # sandbox
curl -s http://localhost:8090/health | python3 -m json.tool   # atlas-proxy

# Functional test
echo "Create hello.py that prints hello world" | atlas
```

All health endpoints should return `{"status": "ok"}` or `{"status": "healthy"}`.

> **Note:** Plain `atlas` in an interactive terminal launches the Bubbletea TUI for the full agent loop (tool calls, V3 pipeline, file read/write). Pipe mode (e.g. the `echo | atlas` form above) routes through the built-in `/solve` flow for scripted/one-shot use.

### Stopping

```bash
docker compose down          # Stop all services (preserves images)
docker compose down --rmi all  # Stop and remove images (next start rebuilds)
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f llama-server    # Follow llama-server logs
docker compose logs -f geometric-lens  # Follow Lens logs
docker compose logs -f v3-service      # Follow V3 pipeline logs
docker compose logs -f atlas-proxy     # Follow proxy logs
docker compose logs -f sandbox         # Follow sandbox logs
docker compose logs --tail 50          # Last 50 lines from all services
```

### Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose down
docker compose pull          # grab fresh :latest images from GHCR
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Method 2: Bare Metal

Run all services as local processes without containers. Useful for development or systems where Docker isn't available.

### Additional Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Go 1.24+** | For building atlas-proxy |
| **llama.cpp** | Built from source with CUDA (see [llama.cpp build instructions](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#build)) |
| **Node.js 20+** | Required by sandbox for JavaScript/TypeScript execution |
| **Rust** | Required by sandbox for Rust execution |

### Build

```bash
# 1. Clone and install Python CLI
git clone https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS
pip install -e .

# 2. Download model weights
mkdir -p models
wget https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf \
     -O models/Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf

# 3. Build the proxy
cd proxy
go build -o ~/.local/bin/atlas-proxy-v2 .
cd ..

# 4. Install geometric-lens Python dependencies
pip install -r geometric-lens/requirements.txt

# 5. Install V3 service PyTorch (CPU only)
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 6. Install sandbox dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn pylint pytest pydantic
```

### Start Services

Start each service in a separate terminal (or use `&` and redirect to log files):

```bash
# Terminal 1: llama-server (GPU)
llama-server \
  --model models/Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K.gguf \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
  --ctx-size 32768 --n-gpu-layers 99 --no-mmap

# Terminal 2: Geometric Lens
cd geometric-lens
LLAMA_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
LLAMA_EMBED_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
GEOMETRIC_LENS_ENABLED=true \
PROJECT_DATA_DIR=/tmp/atlas-projects \
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8099

# Terminal 3: V3 Pipeline
cd v3-service
ATLAS_INFERENCE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
ATLAS_LENS_URL=http://localhost:8099 \
ATLAS_SANDBOX_URL=http://localhost:8020 \
python main.py

# Terminal 4: Sandbox
cd sandbox
python executor_server.py

# Terminal 5: atlas-proxy
ATLAS_PROXY_PORT=8090 \
ATLAS_INFERENCE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
ATLAS_LLAMA_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
ATLAS_LENS_URL=http://localhost:8099 \
ATLAS_SANDBOX_URL=http://localhost:8020 \
ATLAS_V3_URL=http://localhost:8070 \
ATLAS_MODEL_NAME=Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K \
atlas-proxy-v2
```

> **Note:** The sandbox listens on port **8020** in bare-metal mode (no Docker port remapping). The proxy's `ATLAS_SANDBOX_URL` must use port 8020, not 30820.

### Start with the Launcher Script

Alternatively, copy the launcher script to your PATH:

```bash
cp /path/to/atlas-launcher ~/.local/bin/atlas
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/atlas
atlas    # Starts all missing services and launches the TUI
```

The launcher auto-detects which services are already running and starts only what's missing. If it detects a Docker Compose stack, it connects to that instead.

---

## Method 3: K3s

For production Kubernetes deployment with GPU scheduling, health probes, and resource limits.

### Additional Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **K3s** | Single-node or multi-node cluster |
| **NVIDIA GPU Operator** or **device plugin** | GPU must be visible as `nvidia.com/gpu` resource |
| **Helm** | For GPU Operator installation |
| **Podman or Docker** | For building container images |

### Automated Install

The install script handles the complete setup — K3s installation, GPU Operator, container builds, and deployment:

```bash
# 1. Configure
cp atlas.conf.example atlas.conf
# Edit atlas.conf: model paths, GPU layers, context size, NodePorts

# 2. Run the installer (requires root)
sudo scripts/install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Check prerequisites (NVIDIA drivers, GPU VRAM, system RAM)
2. Install K3s if not already running
3. Install NVIDIA GPU Operator via Helm (if GPU not visible to cluster)
4. Build container images and import to K3s containerd
5. Generate manifests from `atlas.conf` via envsubst
6. Deploy to the `atlas` namespace
7. Wait for all services to be healthy

### Manual Deploy

If K3s is already running with GPU support:

```bash
# 1. Configure

### K3s-Specific Configuration

K3s uses `atlas.conf` (not `.env`) for configuration. The HTTP contracts and pipeline behavior are identical to Docker Compose; only deployment plumbing differs:

| Setting | Docker Compose | K3s |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Config file | `.env` | `atlas.conf` |
| Service exposure | Host ports (`8090`, `8080`, `8099`, `8070`, `30820`) | NodePorts (`30080`, `32735`, `31144`, `30070`, `30820`) |
| Project workspace | Bind mount (`ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR` → `/workspace`) | `hostPath` (`ATLAS_PROJECTS_DIR` → `/workspace` on every Pod that needs it) |
| Model files | Bind mount (`ATLAS_MODELS_DIR` → `/models:ro`) | `hostPath` on the GPU node (`ATLAS_MODELS_DIR`, `Directory`, ro) |
| Stateful storage | Named volumes (`redis-data`, `lens-data`) | PVCs (`redis-data` sized by `ATLAS_PVC_REDIS_SIZE`, `lens-projects` by `ATLAS_PVC_PROJECTS_SIZE`) |
| GPU allocation | `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` (nvidia) | `resources.limits.nvidia.com/gpu: 1` (requires GPU Operator or device plugin) |
| Sandbox toolchain caches | `tmpfs` mounts per language | `emptyDir` with `sizeLimit` per language (PC-191 universal pattern, same set) |

Model + runtime parameters (`ATLAS_MAIN_MODEL`, `ATLAS_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, `ATLAS_PARALLEL_SLOTS`, `ATLAS_FLASH_ATTENTION`, KV cache quantization, `--embeddings` for the lens scoring path) all read from the same env vars in both modes — see `atlas.conf.example` and `.env.example`.

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for the full `atlas.conf` reference.

### Verify K3s Deployment

```bash
# Check pods
kubectl get pods -n atlas

# Check GPU allocation
kubectl describe nodes | grep nvidia.com/gpu

# Run verification suite
scripts/verify-install.sh
```

> **Note:** Docker Compose is the most heavily-exercised deployment method (CI runs against it; every release is smoke-tested under Compose). K3s manifests are generated from `templates/*.yaml.tmpl` at deploy time via `scripts/generate-manifests.sh` (or `install.sh`'s `process_templates` step). Templates target the current `Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K` working point and the May 2 2026 service layout (`atlas-proxy`, no api-portal, no dashboard); the V3.0 benchmark numbers in CHANGELOG were collected on `Qwen3-14B` under an older topology.

## Hardware Sizing

ATLAS classifies GPUs into 5 tiers and recommends a model + context
size + parallel-slots configuration per tier. Run `atlas tier` to see
which tier your hardware lands in and the exact `.env` values to use.

| Tier | VRAM | Recommended model | Context | Slots | Example GPUs |
|------|------|-------------------|--------:|------:|--------------|
| **cpu** | n/a | not supported in v1 | n/a | n/a | (no CUDA GPU) |
| **small** | 8–12 GB | Qwen3.5 7B Q4_K_M (4.4 GB) | 8K | 1 | RTX 3060/4060 8GB, T4 |
| **medium** | 12–20 GB | Qwen3.5 9B Q6_K (6.9 GB) | 32K | 1 | RTX 4060/5060 Ti 16GB, 3080 Ti, 4070 Ti Super |
| **large** | 20–32 GB | Qwen3.5 14B Q5_K_M (10.5 GB) | 32K | 2 | RTX 3090, 4090, 5090 24GB |
| **xlarge** | 32 GB+ | Qwen3.5 32B Q5_K_M (23 GB) | 64K | 2 | RTX 5090 32GB, A6000, A100, H100 |

```bash
atlas tier              # classify this host + show recommendations
atlas tier list         # show all 5 tier definitions
atlas tier --json       # machine output (for scripts)
atlas tier --raw        # just the probe (no classification)
```

The medium tier is the ATLAS development target — `atlas-bootstrap.sh`
defaults to its model+context settings. For other tiers, run
**`atlas init`** (the PC-054 first-run wizard) after the bootstrap
completes. It probes hardware via `atlas tier`, picks the right model
from the registry, downloads it with SHA verification, and rewrites
`.env`. Re-run with `atlas init --reconfigure` whenever your hardware
or model registry default changes.

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| GPU VRAM | 8 GB | 16 GB | See tier table above |
| System RAM | 14 GB | 16 GB+ | PyTorch runtime + container overhead |
| Disk | 15 GB | 25 GB | Model (4.4–23 GB depending on tier) + container images (5–8 GB) + working space |
| CPU | 4 cores | 8+ cores | V3 pipeline is CPU-intensive during repair phases |

### Supported GPUs

Any GPU with 8 GB+ VRAM and a llama.cpp-supported backend:

| Vendor | Backend | Status | Build path | Tested cards |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA | CUDA | Shipping (V3.1.0+) | `inference/Dockerfile.v31` | RTX 5060 Ti 16GB (primary dev) |
| AMD | ROCm / HIP | Shipping (V3.1.1) | `inference/Dockerfile.rocm` | RX 7900 XTX (community smoke-test, [GH #26](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/26)) |
| Apple Silicon | Metal | V3.1.2 planned (native install, no Docker) | TBD | M3 Pro 18GB / M3 Max 36GB (target) |
| Intel Arc | SYCL | Roadmap | TBD | Arc A770 16GB (target) |

`atlas tier` auto-detects across vendors and picks the largest-VRAM GPU. Override with `ATLAS_GPU_VENDOR=amd` or `ATLAS_GPU_INDEX=1` if you have multiple GPUs and want a specific one.

#### CUDA Compute Capability (Dockerfile.v31)

`inference/Dockerfile.v31` compiles llama.cpp for a specific CUDA compute capability. The default is `120;121` (Blackwell, RTX 50xx). If you see build failures like `nvcc fatal: unsupported gpu architecture` or runtime errors like `no kernel image available for execution`, your GPU needs a different arch.

Override at build time with `--build-arg CUDA_ARCH=<value>`:

```bash
# Single arch — RTX 4060/4070/4080/4090 (Ada Lovelace)
podman build --build-arg CUDA_ARCH=89 -f inference/Dockerfile.v31 -t llama-server:local inference/

# Multiple archs (semicolon-separated) — build a fat binary for Ampere + Ada + Hopper
podman build --build-arg CUDA_ARCH="86;89;90" -f inference/Dockerfile.v31 -t llama-server:local inference/
```

Common values:

| Arch | Architecture | Cards |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `60`, `61` | Pascal | GTX 10xx, Tesla P4/P40 |
| `70` | Volta | V100 |
| `75` | Turing | RTX 20xx, T4 |
| `80`, `86` | Ampere | A100, RTX 30xx |
| `89` | Ada Lovelace | RTX 40xx, L4 |
| `90` | Hopper | H100 |
| `100`, `120`, `121` | Blackwell | B100, RTX 50xx |

Your GPU's compute capability: `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv` (drop the dot — `8.9` → `89`).

#### AMD GPU Targets (Dockerfile.rocm, V3.1.1)

`inference/Dockerfile.rocm` compiles llama.cpp's HIP backend for one or more `gfx` targets. The default is a fat build covering the most common consumer + datacenter AMD GPUs: `gfx1100;gfx1101;gfx1102;gfx1030;gfx90a`. Each additional target adds ~150 MB to the binary.

Override at build time with `--build-arg GFX_TARGET=<value>` (or via `ATLAS_GFX_TARGET` env var, which the compose override forwards):

```bash
# Single target — RX 7900 XT/XTX only (smaller image)
ATLAS_GFX_TARGET=gfx1100 docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rocm.yml build llama-server

# Two targets for RDNA3 + RDNA2 mixed-fleet
docker build --build-arg GFX_TARGET="gfx1100;gfx1030" -f inference/Dockerfile.rocm -t atlas-llama-rocm:custom inference/
```

Common values:

| Target | Architecture | Cards |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| `gfx1100` | RDNA3 (Navi 31) | RX 7900 XT, 7900 XTX, 7900 GRE |
| `gfx1101` | RDNA3 (Navi 32) | RX 7800 XT, 7700 XT |
| `gfx1102` | RDNA3 (Navi 33) | RX 7600, 7600 XT |
| `gfx1030` | RDNA2 (Navi 21) | RX 6800, 6800 XT, 6900 XT, 6950 XT |
| `gfx1031` | RDNA2 (Navi 22) | RX 6700 XT, 6750 XT |
| `gfx1032` | RDNA2 (Navi 23) | RX 6600, 6600 XT, 6650 XT |
| `gfx90a` | CDNA2 | MI210, MI250, MI250X |
| `gfx942` | CDNA3 | MI300X |
| `gfx900` | Vega | Vega 56/64 (may need HSA override — see TROUBLESHOOTING.md) |

Your GPU's gfx target: `rocminfo | grep -i gfx | head -1` (or look it up in the [LLVM AMDGPU processor table](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html)).

## Geometric Lens Weights (Optional)

ATLAS works without Geometric Lens weights — the service degrades gracefully, returning neutral scores. The V3 pipeline falls back to sandbox-only verification.

To enable C(x)/G(x) scoring, you need trained model weights. Pre-trained weights and training data are available on HuggingFace:

**[ATLAS Dataset on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/itigges22/ATLAS)** — includes embeddings, training data, and weight files.

Place weight files in `geometric-lens/geometric_lens/models/` (or mount via `ATLAS_LENS_MODELS` in Docker Compose). The service loads them automatically on startup.

Training scripts are provided in `scripts/` if you want to train on your own benchmark data:
- `scripts/retrain_cx_phase0.py` — Initial C(x) training from collected embeddings
- `scripts/retrain_cx.py` — Production C(x) retraining with class weights
- `scripts/collect_lens_training_data.py` — Collect pass/fail embeddings from benchmark runs
- `scripts/prepare_lens_training.py` — Prepare and validate training data format

### Bringing your own model (V3.1.1)

If you want to swap in a non-default GGUF, the `atlas lens` subcommand wraps the probe + train pipeline so you don't have to learn the underlying scripts:

```bash
# 1. Drop your GGUF in models/ and update .env to point at it, restart llama-server.

# 2. Probe whether the existing artifacts can score it (cheap, no training):
atlas lens check
# Reports: compat (artifacts work) | needs-build (different dim) | incompatible

# 3. If 'needs-build', train fresh artifacts at the model's native embedding dim:
atlas lens build --samples path/to/labeled.json
# samples format: [{"text": str, "label": 0|1}, ...] where 1 = passing code
# Canonical training set: huggingface.co/datasets/itigges22/ATLAS

# 4. Re-run check — should now report compat:
atlas lens check
```

## ASA Steering Vector (Auto-Built)

May 2026 BiasBusters #4. A residual-stream steering vector that biases
the model toward `ast_edit` over `edit_file` for whole-function /
class / element rewrites, applied **before** the grammar gate has a
chance to reject anything. Strictly optional — ATLAS continues to work
without it, just with an unsteered tool-selection bias.

`atlas-bootstrap.sh` builds it automatically as Step 8.5, after the
services come up. The pipeline is:

1. `build_cvector_prompts.py` turns the committed
   `geometric-lens/asa_calibration/contrast_pairs.jsonl` (1000 pairs)
   into positive / negative prompt files.
2. The bootstrap stops `llama-server` briefly, runs
   `llama-cvector-generator` as a one-shot container with `--method mean
   -ngl 99`, writes `models/ast_edit_steering.gguf`, then restarts
   `llama-server`.
3. `inference/entrypoint-v3.1-9b.sh` sees the file on the next start
   and appends `--control-vector-scaled
   /models/ast_edit_steering.gguf:0.5` to the `llama-server` command
   line.

Total wall time on a 16GB GPU: ~5 minutes. Build runs on the same
hardware the model lives on; the resulting vector is model-specific
(do not move an `ast_edit_steering.gguf` built against
`Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K` to a host running a different base model).

**Override behavior** (set in `.env` if you want to tune):

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR` | `/models/ast_edit_steering.gguf` | Override path |
| `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR_SCALE` | `0.5` | Conservative. Bump to 1.0–1.5 if the bias is too subtle, drop toward 0.2 if non-tool tasks degrade. |
| `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR_LAYER_RANGE` | (all layers) | Pass two integers, e.g. `"24 30"`, to scope to a layer band. Narrower = safer but weaker. |

**If the local build fails** (e.g. cvector-generator missing in an
older `atlas-llama` image, GPU OOM, network hiccup pulling the
runtime), the bootstrap falls back to downloading a prebuilt
`ast_edit_steering.gguf` from the
[ATLAS HuggingFace dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/itigges22/ATLAS).
If that also fails the install completes with a warning — `atlas
doctor` will flag the gap as `warn`, not `fail`.

To skip the build entirely, set `ATLAS_BOOTSTRAP_SKIP_ASA=1` before
running the installer.

To rebuild manually (re-curated pairs, different `--method`, different
base model), see
[`geometric-lens/asa_calibration/README.md`](../geometric-lens/asa_calibration/README.md).
