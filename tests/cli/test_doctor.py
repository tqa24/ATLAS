"""Tests for atlas.cli.commands.doctor (focused on #32 macOS hybrid).

The existing doctor checks (gpu, compose, container health, etc) don't
have unit tests yet — they're integration-shaped and mostly tested by
real CI runs. These tests cover the new check_metal_native() added in
#32 because:
  1. It's pure-logic + filesystem (no Docker, no slow network)
  2. The failure modes are exactly the ones a Mac user will hit
     (binary missing, not executable, not listening) and we want
     fast feedback when they regress
  3. The Linux + skip path matters too — the check must be a no-op
     for non-Mac users
