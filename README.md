## 🌎 What is ATLAS?

ATLAS is a coding assistant that runs on your own GPU. Point it at a project and it does the kind of work you'd ask Claude or Copilot to do: read a codebase, write a feature, fix a bug. The model never leaves your machine.

Every hosted AI tool is a subscription, a privacy tradeoff, and a vendor you trust to stick around. ATLAS isn't any of those. Your code stays on your hardware. You don't pay per token. If the project disappears tomorrow, your install keeps working.

Open models historically can't keep up with hosted ones. ATLAS gets there anyway with a layer of inference scaffolding: planning before generation, verifying answers against self-generated tests, repairing failures. The 14B reference build scored 74.6% on LiveCodeBench. ATLAS canonically runs a 9B that fits on a $500 GPU, but isn't tied to any one model.

5. **[Sandbox](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#6-sandbox)** - isolated execution for build verification.
   - Multi-language execution: Python, Rust, Go, C, Shell, others
   - Compilation and linting before scoring
   - Runs both generated and existing test suites

6. **[llama-server](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#6-llama-server)** - local LLM inference on one consumer GPU.
   - GPU-accelerated quantized inference (Q6_K / Q4_K_M) — NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm, Apple Metal (macOS hybrid), and Vulkan; Intel SYCL on the roadmap
   - Grammar-constrained decoding at the token level
   - Self-embeddings, so the lens doesn't need a second model

## 🚀 Get Started

One-shot install:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itigges22/ATLAS/main/scripts/atlas-bootstrap.sh | bash
```
The script detects your distro (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, Fedora, Rocky, Alma) and your GPU vendor (NVIDIA → nvidia-container-toolkit; AMD → ROCm device passthrough), installs the appropriate runtime, downloads the model weights, builds the ASA steering vector, and starts the stack. Expect 10-30 minutes; the model download is the bottleneck.

Then in any project directory, run `atlas`.

**Requirements**

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU | 16 GB+ VRAM. NVIDIA (CUDA), AMD (ROCm), or Apple Silicon (Metal, macOS hybrid); Vulkan covers most other GPUs. See [SETUP.md § Supported GPUs](docs/SETUP.md#supported-gpus). |
| Runtime | Docker (NVIDIA: + nvidia-container-toolkit; AMD: standalone Docker is enough) or Podman |
| Python | 3.9+ |
| Disk | ~20 GB CUDA / ~22 GB ROCm (model weights + container images) |

Apple Silicon runs natively through the macOS hybrid Metal path (native llama-server + Docker for the rest — see **[SETUP_MACOS.md](docs/SETUP_MACOS.md)**); Intel Arc (SYCL) is on the roadmap. For the manual install path (Docker Compose, bare-metal, K3s) and the full set of bootstrap flags, see **[SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Linux Docker stack, plus a native macOS path.** NVIDIA, AMD ROCm, and Vulkan Docker paths ship today; Apple Silicon runs via the native macOS hybrid Metal path ([#32](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/32)). Intel Arc / SYCL is on the roadmap.
- **9B model is not formally benchmarked yet.** V3.1.0 ships Qwen3.5-9B with the full V3 pipeline, but the canonical 74.6% LiveCodeBench score is from the 14B reference build. Formal 9B numbers land with V3.1.1. The 14B methodology and ablations live in [`docs/reports/V3_ABLATION_STUDY.md`](docs/reports/V3_ABLATION_STUDY.md); raw traces are on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/itigges22/ATLAS).
- **Complex feature additions can be inconsistent.** The model sometimes spends agent turns exploring an unfamiliar codebase before writing code. Reliability has improved on the 9B build since the V3.0 measurement; a fresh number lands with the V3.1.1 benchmark pass.
- **Grammar-constrained decoding is slow.** Around 51 tok/s on llama-server.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**V3.1.0** - Current release. Bubbletea TUI as the canonical chat client (PC-062), `atlas init` first-run wizard (PC-054), `atlas doctor` install diagnostic (PC-053), `atlas tier` hardware-aware presets (PC-055), K3s deployment templates restored, ASA steering vectors auto-built during install (BiasBusters #4).

**V3.1.1** - Broader hardware reach (landed on `main`).
- AMD ROCm via llama.cpp — including RDNA4 / RX 9070 (gfx1200/gfx1201) and community-verified cards ([#26](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/26)).
- Apple Silicon — native macOS hybrid Metal path: native llama-server for inference perf, Docker for the rest of the stack ([#32](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/32), see [SETUP_MACOS.md](docs/SETUP_MACOS.md)).
- Vulkan universal fallback — one image covering AMD / Intel / Snapdragon / Apple-via-MoltenVK / CPU ([#114](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/114)).
- Formal 9B benchmarks — LiveCodeBench, GPQA Diamond, SciCode on Qwen3.5-9B (in progress, [#28](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/28)).

**V3.1.2** - Next point release: bring-your-own-model + cluster.
- ASA per-model calibration parity ([#113](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/113)) and local Lens training pipeline ([#100](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/100)) — train ASA / Lens artifacts for non-default GGUFs.
- Automated HuggingFace submission pipeline ([#102](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/102)).
- ROCm on K3s / Kubernetes — `/dev/kfd` + `/dev/dri` hostPath mounts and `render`/`video` group membership in the Pod spec (the cluster equivalent of `docker-compose.rocm.yml`).

**V3.2** - Next milestone: deeper code reasoning and planning.
- Architecture-first planning phase — RPG-style plan-then-fill: plan at module scope, then implement at function scope ([#120](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/120)).
- Structural code reasoning — call graph + reachability via tree-sitter, plus syntax-agnostic wavelet feature decomposition for multi-resolution "which files matter" retrieval ([#39](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/39)).
- Reasoning with sampling — efficiency and quality gains ([#9](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/9)).

**Backlog / help wanted**
- Hardware: ARM64 multi-arch builds ([#115](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/115)), multi-GPU for larger models ([#34](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/34)), Intel oneAPI / SYCL ([#27](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/27)).
- Tooling: VS Code / JetBrains extension ([#35](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/35)).
- Sandbox languages: Java / Kotlin ([#29](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/29)), Ruby / PHP ([#30](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/30)).
- Architecture: model-agnostic platform ([#66](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/66)), SQLite over Redis ([#57](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/57)).

## 💖 Support ATLAS

ATLAS is built by a single college student in his free time on a single consumer GPU. If the project has been useful to you and you want to help keep it sustainable, please consider **[sponsoring on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/itigges22)**.

Sponsorship directly funds:

- **Compute & hardware** — more GPUs for faster benchmark iteration, access to architectures the maintainer can't afford (AMD ROCm, higher VRAM cards, cloud rentals for larger-model experiments).
- **Contributor bounties** — meaningful compensation for external contributors who put real time into substantive PRs, so ATLAS can grow faster than a single-person pace allows.
- **Research** — continued academic engagement around the architecture, from future workshop and conference submissions to paper writing and collaborations that validate and extend the approach.
- **Community** — continued support for the community and platforms ATLAS runs on, including documentation, user-facing channels, and educational content that help ATLAS reach more developers and better serve the ones already using it.

Every sponsor is credited in the release notes of the version they helped fund.

## 🤝 Contributing

We're building ATLAS in the open and we're actively looking for contributors and core maintainers. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding accelerator support, or rethinking a whole subsystem - there's a place for you here. If you believe open models deserve better infrastructure, come build with us.

Found a bug or hit a wall? **[Open an issue](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues)** - you don't need to submit a fix. Bug reports and feedback help just as much as code.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for guidelines.
